# energySim

This project simulates residential energy deployment with options for solar panels, battery storage and grid electricity with tiered pricing. A Streamlit app provides an interactive UI to explore different configurations and visualize hourly energy flows.

## Setup

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the interactive app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Streamlit interface
- `energy_sim/` - simulation code
- `requirements.txt` - Python package requirements
